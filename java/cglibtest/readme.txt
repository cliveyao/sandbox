Introduction
------------
This project explores use of cglib for specific cases.
Some of the use case have also been implemented in the javaproxytets project.

Experiences
-----------
- Use of cglib is not straightforward. InvokeHandler is more xomplex compared to Java Proxy.
  Combination of cglib & generics is not easy.
  Cglib is more powerful and flexible. Thus more complex.
