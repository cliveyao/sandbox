The objective of this project is to explore maven Jacaco configuration
and execution in Jenkins

The following sources were used to create a maven project
http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html.

From this source I have learned move about configuring jacaco
https://github.com/pkainulainen/maven-examples/tree/master/code-coverage-jacoco.

This article tells howto configure Jenkins to get code coverage reports
so that the results look like cobertura-maven-plugin
https://dzone.com/articles/jacoco-jenkins-plugin.

There is also a Jenkins jacoco Plugin. Seems logical to use but
initially I was interested to get same Jenkins view as with cobertura-maven-plugin.
