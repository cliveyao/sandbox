Introduction
------------
This project contains a JNI project that uses a header/dyn.lib 
that is located in the same project.

The building of the dynamic lib resides in the cpp folder.

Experience
----------
Compiling & link is ok. Configuration settings reside in the pom.xml.
But to run test cases I need to copy the library.
