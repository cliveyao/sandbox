There is a bug in hibernate that generates error messages. See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12054422/unsuccessful-alter-table-xxx-drop-constraint-yyy-in-hibernate-jpa-hsqldb-standa
Dialect is set in the persistence.xml
As alternative I tried an update of Hibernate to 4.3.5.FInal. But I got errors and reverted changes.
