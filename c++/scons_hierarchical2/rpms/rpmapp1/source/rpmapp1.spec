# The used NOTATION is through macro's are shown below.  
# Use macros for directory names where possible, which can be viewed at Packaging:RPMMacros 
# (e.g. use %{_bindir}/mycommand instead of /usr/bin/mycommand). 
# If the pattern begins with a "/" (or when expanded from the macro) then it is taken from 
# the %{buildroot} directory. Otherwise, the file is presumed to be in the current directory 
# (e.g. inside %{_builddir}, such as documentation files that you wish to include)
