Requires: /usr/sbin/groupadd /usr/sbin/useradd
# next line prevents running scripts during RPM installation that check if all dynamic lib dependencies can be resolved.
# scripts are listed here: http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-depend-auto-depend.html
Autoreq: no
# There is also a autoreqprov, which is used at package creation time.
# http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-inside-tags.html#S3-RPM-INSIDE-AUTOREQPROV-TAG
# The autoreqprov tag is used to control the automatic dependency processing performed when the package is being built.
# BUT it doesn't help to find the dynamic libraries packaged in the RPM.
